## Published Guides

### Zero-Cost Enterprise Email Architecture

Full production guide: [guides.trujillomingorance.com/guides/enterprise-email/](https://guides.trujillomingorance.com/guides/enterprise-email/)

This guide covers building a complete transactional and corporate email setup for startups and engineering teams without paying recurring seat licenses for Google Workspace or Microsoft 365.

Topics covered:
- DNS Records: Comprehensive DKIM (2048-bit RSA), SPF with strict enforcement (`-all`), DMARC policies (`p=reject`), and BIMI/Gravatar verified avatar delivery.
- Cloudflare Email Routing: Forwarding inbound corporate emails to personal or team inboxes with SPF alignment.
- Resend API & SMTP Relay: Sending outbound mail with custom domain authentication and high deliverability.
- Email Client Configuration: Connecting mobile and desktop mail clients (Gmail, Apple Mail, Thunderbird) using SMTP submission on port 587 (TLS).

---

## Technical Stack and Principles

- Static Engine: Semantic HTML5 and modern CSS with custom properties, glassmorphism card surfaces, and accessible typography.
- Edge Hosting: Cloudflare Pages with global anycast distribution and aggressive edge caching.
- Theme: Dark corporate slate (#080c14) with subtle acrylic borders and high-contrast text.
- Internationalization: Client-side language switcher supporting Spanish and English.
- Extensibility: Standardized article template (`guide-template.html`) making it straightforward to author and publish new documentation.
